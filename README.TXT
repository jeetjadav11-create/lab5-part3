TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.


This project implements a technical support system for customers of the 
DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

43) puts the value to the key (if the key is not mapped to a value and returns null or with the key)

44)tried to do it but didnt work 

45)cant do this ethier 

46) its kind of complte but its missing a lot of things ,specillay details. it is quite accurate .its good for big programs to see them clearly , but for me its not very useful because it dosent show all the methods uesd inside 

47) there is two  Version:7.3Author:Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes there are at the start of the documentation

48)there is mant exemple Version:sreail ,seraildata etc 

49) its already done?
